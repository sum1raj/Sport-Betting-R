#AUTOMATE SIMPLIFYING A GLM USING glmulti FUNCTION

library(rJava)
library(glmulti)

model<- #define formula here e.g. score~team+position+x

simple_model<-glmulti(model,data = data, crit   = aic, level  = 2, method = "h", family = binomial, fitfunction = glm,  confsetsize = 100)   # Keep 100 best models

#level is 2 if including interactions. Family will need updating depending on the response variable.
#If will not run with method= "h" (exhaustive), use method= "g" (genetic algorithm).

#OR TO SIMPLIFY A MULTINOMIAL MODEL BUILT WITH NNET:

simple_model <- glmulti(model, data = data, level  = 2, method = "h", fitfunction = multinom)

#EXTRACT BEST MODEL AND TEST

best_model<-simple_model[1,1]
